# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented in **Ruby**. Two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their chosen symbols (`*` or `0`). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
